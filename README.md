### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mithat. I graduated from the department of business administration in 2017. I have experience in various industries. But I realized that I am not happy with the work I do. I started working on software during the pandemic period. I started to feel good. Since that day, I spend my time improving myself and learning. I'm taking a frontend developer course with Angular and React js at Bilge Adam.
